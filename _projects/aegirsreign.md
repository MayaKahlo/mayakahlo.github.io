For our final proejct our class was tasked with creating a social distancing-friendly game engaging enough for college students that went with the theme <i> Amazing Race </i>. My team was assigned the country Norway and we decided to make a touch-free reaction game, called Ægir’s Reign, that challenged players to survive for as long as possible by combatting enemy fire coming from multiple “lanes” at a given time.

In the game, the player is trying to navigate through the caves of Norway on their ship while escaping a Viking armada in pursuit of them. The player must call upon Ægir, the Norse God of the Sea, to fend off the incoming troops with his powers of ocean manipulation to avoid being captured.

The player controls a servo that directs Ægir's powers to a specific lane in which the troops are coming from. Using a foot pedal, they send a powerful blast to obliterate the enemy ship; they must last as long as possible before any of the armada's ships can reach them. The player chooses between the different lanes by breaking infrared beams with their hands and “fire” down a lane to destroy an enemy using a foot pedal placed on the ground. Sound cues indicate when a new enemy has spawned, with a different jingle used for each lane. Our team’s goal was to create a fast-paced, competitive, and addicting game which at first glance looks easy but requires more focus and coordination than expected.

Here is a video of our gameplay:
