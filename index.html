My name is Maya De Los Santos and I am a senior pursuing Electrical and Computer Engineering in Northeastern University’s Honors Program. Throughout my undergraduate studies I have remained dedicated to uplifting marginalized communities and empowering them to have agency over their personal data and promote their well-being.</p> <p>My goal is to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science, with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction and Design. I am particularly interested in exploring how meaningful design can combat digital resignation – the phenomenon where people care about their personal data but feel powerless in exercising control over it.</p> <p>delossantos [dot] m [at] northeastern [dot] edu</p> <p><a href="https://mayakahlo.github.io/projects/" class="button button1"> Check out my projects here</a></p> </body></html>
